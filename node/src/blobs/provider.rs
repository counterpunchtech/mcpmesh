/// iroh-blobs that honors the per-type fields still refuses them WITHOUT serving bytes:
///  - `get_many` / `push` = `RequestMode::Disabled`: the crate refuses this request type at the

///    Err(e!(ProgressError::Permission))`), doc at `events.rs:62-66`. Our legitimate clients only
///    ever do a single-blob `get`, so disabling these breaks nothing. (`push` is `Disabled` in
///    `EventMask::DEFAULT` already; pinning it makes the intent explicit.)
///  - `observe` = `ObserveMode::Intercept`: `ObserveMode` has NO `Disabled` variant
