//! Suspend/resume detection (#167 ask 2): the watcher that pushes a [`StreamFrame::Resumed`] when
//! this machine wakes from a sleep, so an embedder holding long-lived sessions can re-dial
//! deliberately instead of discovering the loss on its next send.
//!
//! While a machine is suspended it sends nothing, so the PEER's idle timer runs out and tears the
//! connection down before the lid is even reopened. `[network].keep_alive_secs` cannot help — a
//! suspended process emits no PINGs — and `idle_timeout_secs` is negotiated to the minimum of both
//! peers, so surviving a lid close would need every peer in the mesh raised in lockstep to a value
//! covering the longest expected sleep. #167 says that plainly: this needs reconnection semantics,
//! not transport tuning. The frame is the signal half of those semantics.
//!
//! [`StreamFrame::Resumed`]: mcpmesh_local_api::StreamFrame::Resumed
