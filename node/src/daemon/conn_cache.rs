//! One client connection per remote for MCP sessions (#215).
//!
//! The accept side has multiplexed sessions as separate bi-streams on one connection since 0.1.0
//! (`run_mesh_connection` loops `accept_bi`). The dial side opened one connection per
//! `open_session` out of nothing but convenience, and that is the K ≥ 2 that iroh#4390 turns into
//! an unbounded `pending_open_paths` deque. This cache makes a second session to the same peer a
//! second bi-stream on the connection the first one is already using.
//!
//! **Weak, not strong.** Each entry is a [`WeakConnectionHandle`]: the connection lives exactly as
//! long as some session's streams hold it and dies with the last one, as before. No idle connection
//! is kept warm, so no new keepalive or idle-timeout semantics appear. A stale entry — one that no
//! longer upgrades, or whose `close_reason()` is set — is skipped and replaced by a fresh dial.
//!
//! **Keyed by peer endpoint id, for `ALPN_MCP` only.** Nothing else is ever inserted: app-protocol
//! connections negotiate their own ALPN at handshake and can never share. The reachability probe
//! does not use this cache: it dials `mcpmesh/ping/1` exactly as before, so a peer that something
//! polls briefly has a second connection once per TTL.
//!
//! **Single-flight dials, per device.** Two sessions opened at the same instant to a peer with no
//! live connection would each dial. A caller that finds nothing inserts a `Dialing` slot for every
//! device it is about to dial — one for a single-target dial, one per candidate for a racing dial —
//! and leads; a caller that finds any of its candidates `Dialing` waits for that dial and looks
//! again. So a `b64u:` race and an `eid:` dial to one of the same devices never run side by side. The
//! std mutex is held only for the map lookup/insert — never across an await. A leader that fails, or
//! is cancelled mid-dial, clears its slots on drop so waiters dial for themselves.
//!
//! **What is NOT one connection.** A session with its own `idle_timeout_secs` dials its own
//! connection (the knob is per connection). A connection that has run out of stream credit — the
//! peer's `max_concurrent_bidi_streams`, 100 by default — is not stale, but the next session cannot
//! wait on it indefinitely, so after [`REUSE_OPEN_TIMEOUT`] it dials a connection of its own that is
//! not cached and dies with that session. And a peer that restarts while a dial is in flight can
//! leave the loser of that race alive for its session.
//!
//! **Authorization is the ACCEPTING side's, per stream.** Since #222 `run_session` resolves the
//! caller's principals and the allow list per bi-stream, so a second session on a shared connection
//! is admitted or refused exactly as a fresh connection would be. A peer still on mcpmesh ≤ 0.53.2
//! resolves the caller's identity once per connection, so against such a peer a stream opened after
//! the caller lost a principal is admitted with the principal it had when the connection was
//! accepted — and sharing stretches that window to the shared connection's lifetime.
//!
//! **Revocation.** Three guards, in the order a dial meets them. The dial paths ask `dial_refused`
//! before they reach this cache (`refuse_if_revoked`, and `hinted_addrs` for a race). The cache asks
//! again, through the caller's `refused` predicate, before it hands out a cached connection: a
//! session that waited on another caller's dial passed the first check before that wait, and a
//! revocation written without a revoke verb closes nothing. And the endpoint hooks (#229) close
//! every registered connection to a newly refused device on the revoke verbs and roster installs; a
//! connection closed that way reads as dead here.
//!
//! The hand-out check covers REUSE only. A session that dials for itself after waiting — its leader
//! failed, or the shared connection had no stream credit — does not ask again; on a booted node
//! #229's `before_connect` veto refuses that dial, and on an endpoint without the hooks (a mesh a
//! test assembles by hand) nothing does.
//!
