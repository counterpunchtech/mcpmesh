//! Principal → live-connection resolution for the revoke paths (#54).
//!
//! `service_allow_revoke` and `peer_remove` strip a principal from the config `allow` and reload,
//! which stops NEW sessions. Cutting the sessions already in flight needs the set of ENDPOINTS
//! that principal names, which is what this module computes — the input to
//! [`ConnRegistry::sever_matching`](mcpmesh_net::registry::ConnRegistry::sever_matching).
//!
//! Both identity sources are consulted, because either can be the thing an `allow` entry named:
//! the pairing [`PeerStore`] and the installed roster view. A roster-mode `allow` commonly holds a
//! bare roster `user_id` or a GROUP name, and neither has a `PeerEntry` — resolving only the store
//! would silently sever nothing for exactly those entries while the verb reported success.
//!
//! This is distinct from roster INSTALL severing
//! ([`install_roster_view_and_sever`](super::install_roster_view_and_sever)), which cuts devices a
//! new roster revoked or dropped. Here the operator explicitly withdrew a principal from a
//! service's allow, so that principal's devices are the target regardless of how they authenticate.

/// Four ways a principal can name an endpoint, unioned:
/// 1. a stored device whose `eid:` rendering matches (the device principal);
/// 2. a stored device carrying that `user_id` (a person covers all their paired devices);
/// 3. a roster device whose `eid:` rendering matches;
/// 4. a roster device whose `user_id` OR whose GROUP list contains the principal — the roster
///    vocabulary an `allow` entry may hold.
///
/// Matching RENDERS each endpoint rather than PARSING the principal, so every form is handled
/// without a new parser and an unrecognized principal resolves to the empty set — which severs
/// nothing. Failing to the empty set is the safe direction: over-severing would cut connections
/// the operator never revoked. A display nickname therefore never resolves here, exactly as it
/// never admits (#38).
///
/// Note the boundary: this is the *liveness* half of a revoke. The authorization half is the
/// config `allow` strip plus the live-registry swap; a peer whose `PeerEntry` is deleted outright
/// is already denied at gate resolve.
