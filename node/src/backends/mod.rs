//! Session backends: the two ways the daemon answers a selected
//! service. Each implements `mcpmesh_net::SessionBackend`, so `mcpmesh_net::serve`
//! hands it the stripped `initialize` frame and the by-value transport, and the
//! backend owns the session's teardown.
//!
//! * [`spawn`] — the `run` backend: fork one child MCP server per session, pump
//!   its stdio to/from the transport, inject the resolved identity as env vars.
//! * [`socket`] — the `socket` backend: dial a long-running local MCP server per
//!   session and inject the resolved identity into the forwarded `initialize`
//!   `_meta["mcpmesh/peer"]` (authoritative — overwrites, never merges).
//!
//! Both backends drive the same session shape once their local MCP server's byte
//! stream exists: forward the `initialize`, then pump frames both directions over
//! `pump` with one codec ([`mcpmesh_net::framing`]) on the server side too. The only
//! thing that differs is HOW the server stream is obtained (fork+stdio vs. dial+UDS)
//! and HOW identity is injected (env vars vs. `_meta`).
//!
//! Fidelity is Value/semantic, not byte-for-byte: every
//! frame round-trips through `serde_json::Value` (object keys re-sorted, no
//! `arbitrary_precision`) — the same caveat as the mesh transport. The platform
//! pumps and never INTERPRETS the MCP method/result semantics; it does re-serialize
//! the JSON.

/// MCP lifecycle permits before `initialize`, and which rmcp answers — and sent its real
/// `initialize` as frame 2, which reached the backend verbatim with a forged `mcpmesh/peer`.
///
/// Three steps, because each alone leaves a hole:
///
/// 1. **Strip** every caller-supplied reserved key — `mcpmesh/*` AND
/// `tech.counterpunch.mcpmesh/*` (#49). Unconditional, both backends.
///    `mcpmesh/service` is the key `select_service` acts on, so this is authorization-relevant.
/// 2. **Remove an impersonating `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo`** (#189) — one whose `name` is
///    written in mcpmesh's own `eid:`/`b64u:` principal grammar. Under MCP 2026-07-28 that key
///    lands in the same `_meta` object as the authenticated `mcpmesh/peer`; see
///    [`strip_impersonating_client_info`](mcpmesh_net::service::strip_impersonating_client_info)
///    for why the rest of `clientInfo` is left strictly alone. Returned rather than logged here, so
///    the pump can warn ONCE per session instead of once per caller-controlled frame.
/// 3. **Inject** the authoritative peer into whichever frame is actually the handshake. Stripping
///    alone would leave the backend's real `initialize` carrying no identity at all —
///    unattributable, which is the second harm the issue names.
///
/// `peer_meta` is `None` for the `run` backend, which conveys identity through `MCPMESH_PEER_*` env
/// vars and has no `_meta` seam; inventing one there would make a `run` server see a key that
/// appears on no other release. The strip still applies to it.
