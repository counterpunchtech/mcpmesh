//! Server-side mcpmesh-local/1 dispatch. On each accepted connection the SERVER
//! writes a `Hello` frame FIRST ("the first exchange ... identifies the api"), then reads
//! request frames, dispatches on the `method` string, and writes JSON-RPC-shaped response
//! frames back. Same-uid peers only (the seam's platform gate — peer-euid on unix, owner-only
//! pipe DACL on windows) — the gate runs before the hello.
//!
//! Dispatch discipline: the method is extracted with
//! [`mcpmesh_local_api::method_of`] and params are deserialized PER-METHOD into the typed
//! param structs local-api defines (`protocol.rs` — the one wire truth, so daemon/client
//! shape drift is a compile error) — never by deserializing the whole message into
//! `Request` (adjacent tagging rejects `params:{}` for parameterless methods, which a
//! conforming third-party client may send). Most verbs are plain request/response;
//! `open_session` and `subscribe` are special: after those requests the connection stops
//! being JSON-RPC and becomes a raw MCP byte pipe / a one-way event stream.
