//! Roster DISTRIBUTION: the two automatic convergence channels — the gossip receive loop and the
//! HTTPS URL poll. On a higher-serial announcement (or served body) each fetches the roster bytes
//! and funnels them through the host's SINGLE install pipeline
//! ([`DistributionHost::install_roster_bytes`]: validate → persist → hot-swap → sever, serialized
//! with the manual install). Every accepting node re-seeds its blob + re-announces, so propagation
//! does not depend on the operator staying online. None of the channels validates independently.
//!
//! **The trust boundary is the org-root signature — nothing else.** A gossip announce, the blob it
//! points at, and the `roster_hash` are content-addressed conveniences that only TRIGGER a fetch;
//! they are NOT trust inputs. A stale/equal serial, a hash mismatch, or a validation failure is
//! logged and IGNORED (fail-safe). There is exactly ONE validator, inside the install pipeline,
//! which re-checks `serial > installed` under the host's single-writer lock so a racing URL poll /
//! concurrent announce cannot double-install.
//!
//! This module never sees the daemon's state: everything it needs from its host daemon comes
//! through the narrow [`DistributionHost`] seam the daemon implements.
