//! The long-lived mcpmesh daemon. It owns the single Iroh endpoint (seeded from the device
//! key) and runs two roles simultaneously on one tokio runtime: (1) it runs its
//! OWN accept loop ([`spawn_accept_loop`]) that dispatches each inbound connection by its
//! negotiated ALPN — `mcpmesh/mcp/1` flows through net's gated per-connection handler
//! [`mcpmesh_net::run_mesh_connection`], where `gate` is an
//! [`AllowlistGate`] over the `state.redb` peer allowlist and
//! `services` are backends built from config, while `mcpmesh/pair/1` flows to the pairing
//! rendezvous, GATE-EXEMPT by design and authenticated by the invite secret rather than
//! the trust gate; and (2) it serves the `mcpmesh-local/1` control API on
//! `<runtime_dir>/mcpmesh.sock` (hello + status + service registration + peer add), consumed by
//! the porcelain.
//!
//! The daemon deliberately does not call `mcpmesh_net::serve`: routing by ALPN is the whole
//! point (the gate exemption only applies to the pair ALPN), which the mesh-only `serve`
//! cannot do. `serve`/`ServeHandle` REMAIN in net for its own tests + standalone use; the
//! daemon just composes the same [`mcpmesh_net::run_mesh_connection`] under its own loop.
//!
//! Single-daemon-per-uid: an exclusive non-blocking `flock` on
//! `<runtime_dir>/mcpmesh.lock` is acquired BEFORE any endpoint/store/socket work and held for
//! the process lifetime. This makes `ipc::bind_control_socket`'s stale-socket unlink safe —
//! no LIVE daemon can exist while we hold the lock — and (critically for redb, which takes
//! an exclusive file lock) guarantees exactly one process opens `state.redb`. A redundant
//! daemon loses the lock and exits 0 before touching the device key, store, or endpoint.
