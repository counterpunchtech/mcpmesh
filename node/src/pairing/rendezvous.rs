//! The pairing rendezvous over ALPN `mcpmesh/pair/1`. GATE-EXEMPT by design: a pairing peer is
//! by definition not yet in the allowlist; it is authenticated by possession of the invite
//! secret, not by the trust gate. This module holds BOTH sides: [`handle_inviter_side`] (the
//! accept-time handler) and [`redeem_invite`] (the dialer).
//!
//! **The two writes that make a pairing functional (the load-bearing fact).**
//! Admitting a paired peer to a service needs TWO independent facts on the inviter:
//!  1. a [`PeerEntry`] `{ endpoint_id → nickname }` so the [`AllowlistGate`] RESOLVES the peer's
//!     mesh dial to its nickname (identity/trust); and
//!  2. the peer's nickname in the service's config `[services.<svc>].allow`, so `select_service`
//!     ADMITS that resolved nickname (authorization) — this allow is baked into the [`Services`]
//!     snapshot at `build_services` time, so it takes effect only after a RELOAD.
//!
//! A [`PeerEntry`] alone leaves the peer KNOWN-BUT-FORBIDDEN. [`handle_inviter_side`]
//! writes (1) then calls the [`InviterCtx::grant`] hook for (2) — see the success arm below.
//!
//! **Asymmetric grant.** `invite notes` gives the REDEEMER access to `notes` and
//! gives the INVITER a dial-back entry with NO service grants. So:
//!
//!  - the redeemer's alice-entry has `services = invite.services` (what the redeemer may DIAL);
//!  - the inviter's bob-entry has `services = []` (a dial-back identity row — the inviter may
//!    dial nothing on the redeemer). `PeerEntry.services` is a client-side DIRECTORY of what to
//!    dial, never an authorization input (nothing reads it for admission), so the `[]` here is
//!    semantic cleanliness — but it is the correct encoding of the asymmetry.
//!
//! **Second pairings MERGE, never clobber.** `PeerStore::add` is a replace-on-endpoint_id upsert
//! (a contract other callers rely on), so BOTH rendezvous write sites resolve-then-merge before
//! adding: the redeemer UNIONs a repeat grant into its dial directory and takes the new invite's
//! suggested nickname (rename-by-fresh-invite); the inviter PRESERVES its stored nickname + dial
//! directory (a reverse pairing must not wipe what an earlier redeem granted us) — and neither
//! side ever downgrades a verified `user_id` to `None`, nor a stored `last_addr` (a fresh
//! pairing REFRESHES the dial hint; a merge never replaces `Some` with `None`). See the
//! per-site comments for the rules.
//!
//! This module deliberately never sees the daemon's state: the inviter side runs against the
//! narrow [`InviterCtx`] the daemon assembles (peer store + invite ring + the grant hook), so
//! pairing can be read and tested on its own.
//!
//! [`AllowlistGate`]: crate::allowlist::AllowlistGate
