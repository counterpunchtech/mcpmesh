//! A generic, trust-agnostic registry of live mesh connections, for revocation-severing.
//! `run_mesh_connection` CHECK-REGISTERS each accepted connection and holds the returned RAII
//! [`Registration`] for the connection's lifetime; on close (handler return) the guard
//! DEREGISTERS. The roster install path (cli) calls [`ConnRegistry::sever_matching`] with a
//! predicate computed from the new roster — net owns the MECHANISM (handles + close), the cli owns
//! the POLICY (which to sever).
//!
//! **The TOCTOU close (why a to-be-severed peer can never keep a live session).** A connection's
//! `gate.resolve()` may run BEFORE a roster install swaps the view, but its registration lands
//! AFTER the install's `sever_matching` pass — a naive `register` would let that connection escape
//! severing. We close the race with a CHECKED register serialized on the SAME mutex `sever_matching`
//! takes: [`ConnRegistry::register_checked`] re-evaluates, UNDER the registry lock, the caller's
//! recheck predicate against the live gate (`should_sever_now(eid, roster_user)` — the FULL sever
//! predicate, both halves), and if it fires does NOT insert (the caller self-closes). Combined with
//! the installer's **swap-before-sever** ordering (swap the roster view, THEN sever), every
//! interleaving is safe:
//!  - (i) checked-register wins the mutex, reads the OLD view (swap not yet done) → inserts; the
//!    installer's later `sever_matching` (same mutex, AFTER its swap completed) finds and closes it;
//!  - (ii) swap done, checked-register acquires the mutex, reads the NEW view → should-sever →
//!    self-close, no insert;
//!  - (iii) swap + sever both done, checked-register acquires the mutex, reads the NEW view →
//!    should-sever → self-close, no insert.
//!
//! There is NO interleaving where a to-be-severed endpoint both inserts and survives. (`sever_matching`'s
//! predicate is computed into plain sets BEFORE it takes the mutex, so it holds only the registry
//! lock — no lock cycle with the gate's own lock that the recheck predicate reads.)
//!
//! **Scope — this closes BOTH halves of the sever rule.** The recheck is the full `should_sever`
//! predicate (via the gate's `should_sever_now(eid, roster_user)`), so the three-case argument above
//! extends unchanged to both severing causes. (1) The REVOKED half — a compromised/lost device
//! handled via `org revoke` → `revoked_endpoints` → `is_revoked` — can never keep a live session
//! (revocation is honored even when degraded, fail-closed). (2) The DROPPED-from-roster half — a
//! previously roster-resolved endpoint (`roster_user.is_some()`) now ABSENT from the installed
//! roster but NOT revoked (a benign DEPARTURE: a user removed from the roster) — is ALSO closed by
//! the recheck: `should_sever_now` returns `true` for it under the NEW view, so the
//! register-after-sever race can never leave such a connection live. Both halves are rechecked under
//! the registry lock, serialized against `sever_matching`; a pairing-only endpoint
//! (`roster_user == None`, not revoked) is never severed by a roster install.
