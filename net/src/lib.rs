//! mcpmesh-net: the session kernel of the mcpmesh workspace — endpoint identity,
//! framed transports, trust-gated serving, and connection severing over iroh/QUIC.
//!
//! This crate is shared by the mcpmesh daemon (the serving side) and anything that
//! dials mesh services with full identity control. It deliberately excludes trust
//! POLICY (rosters, pairing, key storage — `mcpmesh-trust` and the daemon own
//! those; this crate only defines the [`TrustGate`] trait they implement) and the
//! wire codec's implementation (owned by `mcpmesh-codec`, re-exported here as
//! [`framing`]). Most integrators talking to a locally-running mesh want
//! `mcpmesh-local-api` instead — it needs no iroh at all.
//!
//! # The iroh pin
//!
//! This crate exact-pins its iroh version and exposes iroh types throughout its
//! public API (`iroh::Endpoint`, `iroh::EndpointAddr`, the stream types inside
//! [`SessionTransport`]). Use the re-export — `mcpmesh_net::iroh::…` — and never
//! add your own `iroh` dependency: any other version is a different crate to the
//! type system, and the first floating requirement breaks the build.
//!
//! # The rmcp pin — and why it is currently a PRERELEASE
//!
//! [`NdjsonTransport`] implements `rmcp::transport::Transport`, so rmcp is in this crate's PUBLIC
//! API exactly as iroh is. The same rule applies, and right now it applies harder: the pin is an
//! exact **prerelease** (`=3.0.0-beta.3`), and Cargo does not match a caret requirement against a
//! prerelease. A downstream writing `rmcp = "3"` — or `rmcp = "2"`, which worked before — gets TWO
//! rmcp crates in the graph, and our `Transport` impl is on a different trait than theirs. It
//! compiles, then fails at the use site with `expected Transport, found Transport`, no version in
//! the message.
//!
//! Use the re-export — `mcpmesh_net::rmcp::…` — and never add your own `rmcp` dependency.
//!
//! Tracking a prerelease is deliberate: we want the SDK ahead of the coming MCP spec change (it
//! already knows `ProtocolVersion::V_2026_07_28` while still defaulting to `V_2025_11_25`). This
//! re-export is what keeps that choice from being a hard break for embedders.
