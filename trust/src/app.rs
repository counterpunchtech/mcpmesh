//! Application-payload signing with the DEVICE key (#59).
//!
//! mcpmesh authenticates the *transport*: inside a session, `_meta["mcpmesh/peer"]` tells a service
//! who is calling. That is exactly right for request/response and useless for a payload that
//! outlives its connection. An embedder doing store-and-forward — offline delivery, an always-on
//! relay, a mailbox, an app-level gossip overlay — handles bytes that arrived from someone other
//! than their author, and the transport authenticated the FORWARDER.
//!
//! Attributing the ORIGIN without this meant minting a second identity per device, with its own
//! storage, backup and revocation story, plus a binding protocol proving "endpoint X asserts app
//! key Y" — security-critical code duplicated in every embedder, sitting next to an ed25519 key
//! that already identifies the device.
//!
//! So: sign with the device key, and verify against the `EndpointId` the transport already
//! authenticates. No second identity, no second chain.
//!
//! # Domain separation is enforced here, not left to callers
//!
//! The preimage is `APP_SIG_DOMAIN ∥ len(domain) ∥ domain ∥ msg`. Two properties follow, and both
//! are properties of the API rather than of caller discipline:
//!
//! 1. **An app signature is never an mcpmesh signature.** [`APP_SIG_DOMAIN`] is a fixed prefix a
//!    caller cannot escape, so no caller-chosen `domain` can produce a preimage under
//!    `mcpmesh/join/device-binding/1`, `mcpmesh/introduce/1`, the roster `sig`, or any domain
//!    mcpmesh adds later — and the reverse holds too. Without it, an embedder that let a peer
//!    choose the bytes it signs would be an oracle for forging mcpmesh's own statements.
//!
//!    Stated precisely, because it is easy to over-claim: **today the length field alone would
//!    also separate them**, since every mcpmesh preimage opens with an ASCII domain string and an
//!    app preimage would open with a small little-endian `u64`. That is an accident of the current
//!    domains, not an invariant — a future mcpmesh preimage with a different shape would erase it
//!    silently. The fixed prefix makes the separation explicit and structural, so it is pinned by
//!    the LAYOUT test rather than left to hold by coincidence.
//! 2. **Two app domains cannot collide.** The length prefix means `(b"ab", b"c")` and
//!    `(b"a", b"bc")` have different preimages. Plain concatenation would let a signature made for
//!    one domain verify under another, which is the whole failure domain separation exists to
//!    prevent — reintroduced one level down.
//!
//! Note what this does NOT do: it says nothing about whether the signer was *entitled* to make the
//! statement. That is the embedder's authorization question, answered from its own state — this
//! answers only "which device produced these bytes".
