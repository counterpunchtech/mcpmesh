//! The platform local-endpoint seam (design §1): ONE narrow API — `connect_local`,
//! `bind_local`, `LocalListener::accept`, `authorize_local_peer`, `split_local` — with
//! per-platform impls. Unix: the family's hardened UDS rule (0700 symlink-refused dir,
//! 0600 socket, same-euid peer gate). Windows: an owner-only-DACL named pipe (the
//! kernel enforces same-user at connect; see `windows.rs`).
//! Everything above this seam is platform-identical: the endpoint value is a `Path`
//! on both (a socket path / a `\\.\pipe\…` name), and both stream types are
//! `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`.
