/// COLLECTION, off unless `[blobs].gc_interval` is set (#80). `blob_unpublish` and `blob_revoke`
/// closed the AUTHORIZATION half at 15; neither reclaimed a byte, so `<data_dir>/blobs/` grew

/// and never republished — reclaimable in themselves (the fetch already wrote the caller's
/// `dest_path`) but it means `blob_republish` of a hash fetched more than one interval ago fails.
/// `blobs_gc` is `None` when collection is not configured, `Some` with `runs: 0` when it is

/// an in-person SAS ceremony with everyone you had ever paired with. **The export response carries
/// a PRIVATE KEY**: it is deliberately absent from the audit log, from `status`, and from every
/// other surface. Import refuses to overwrite an existing key unless asked, because doing so
/// discards a live identity irreversibly. What it does NOT do: get a device admitted. Peers
/// authorize per DEVICE, and a restored user key puts this endpoint in nobody's allowlist — that is
/// #85 ask 3, unshipped, and the reason a recovered person still pairs. Guard on `>= 48`; to 47 with `BlobFetchParams::from` — ADDITIONAL sources a
/// fetch falls back to when the ticket's publisher does not answer (#83). Content addressing makes
/// every recipient a potential source, and a one-address ticket made that unusable: a file shared
/// with a room became unfetchable the moment the sender closed their laptop, though others in the
/// room already held the identical verified bytes. Additive and absent-tolerant — an older caller's
/// payload reads as empty, which is the single-source behaviour — so guard on `>= 47` only before
/// SENDING the field (`deny_unknown_fields` rejects the whole request below it). The bytes stay
/// BLAKE3-verified against the ticket's hash whoever serves them, so an alternate can refuse but
/// never substitute; it must have republished the hash into a scope granting the caller
/// (`blob_republish`, `api_minor >= 18`). What did NOT land: multi-source PARALLEL fetch — sources
/// are tried in order, so an offline publisher costs one dial timeout; to 46 with the roster-mode embedding surface (#66, #93):
/// the `org_create` / `org_approve` / `org_revoke` AUTHORING verbs, the `roster_members` read,
/// `PresencePeer::display_name` + `groups`, `RosterStatus::groups`, and
/// `OrgJoinResult::restart_required`. Two gaps close together. Authoring existed only as CLI
/// porcelain, so an embedded node could CONSUME a roster and never author one — no "approve this
/// person" button without shelling out to a second binary. And the roster's own contents never
/// crossed the seam: an embedder had managed group membership it could not display, and the only
/// route to a member list was hand-parsing the daemon-owned `roster.json`. `roster_members` is a
/// different question from `status.presence` — that lists reachable DEVICES and omits a person
/// whose devices are all down. `restart_required` closes a silent partial success: `roster_mode` is
/// a BOOT decision fixing the bound ALPNs and whether gossip/presence/blobs exist at all, so a
/// pairing-mode node that ran `org_join` got working MCP sessions with permanently empty presence
/// and no way to detect it. Guard on `>= 46` before offering org authoring in a UI; the read fields
/// are additive and degrade to empty. What did NOT land: org root ROTATION (#93c) — an operator
/// laptop that dies still takes the org with it once the roster expires; to 45 with [`PairParams::allow_self_enroll`] +
/// [`ERR_SELF_ENROLL_NOT_OFFERED`] — `pair` now REFUSES a `mcpmesh-enroll:` line unless the caller
/// asked for that ceremony. A behaviour change for existing callers, deliberately: at 43-44 a caller
/// whose UI only ever offered "add a contact" completed a self-enrollment and learned which
/// ceremony it had run from `enrolled_as_self` afterwards — by which point the device→user binding
/// was written and irrevocable short of rotating the user key (#178). The refusal is decided from
/// the line before any dial, so the invite survives it and the same line works once the ceremony is
/// actually offered. Guard on `>= 45` before sending the field — below it `deny_unknown_fields`
/// rejects the whole request. Note what the guard means: a daemon BELOW 45 gives a caller no way to
/// decline, so a UI that does not offer device enrollment should require `>= 45` rather than pair
/// without it; to 44 when control responses stopped arriving in REQUEST
/// order and the `blob_fetch_cancel` verb landed (#172). The daemon now dispatches each request
/// CONCURRENTLY on its connection, so a `blob_fetch` no longer stalls every other verb behind it —
/// and responses arrive in COMPLETION order. JSON-RPC ids make that legal and the in-tree
/// `ControlClient` cannot observe it (one request at a time, by construction), but a hand-rolled
/// client that pipelines and matches responses POSITIONALLY breaks. A connection also caps
/// in-flight requests and refuses over it with [`ERR_TOO_MANY_INFLIGHT`], and closing a control
/// connection now genuinely ABORTS its in-flight work rather than letting it run to completion
/// unread. Guard on `>= 44` before pipelining, before sending `blob_fetch_cancel`, and before
/// treating [`ERR_CANCELLED`] as unexpected; to 43 with `InviteParams::as_self` — SELF-ENROLLMENT, so one
/// person's devices share a `user_id` instead of appearing as unrelated strangers (#86). The
/// ceremony is ordinary pairing; the outcome is a device→user binding rather than a peer row, and
/// the private key never moves. Guard on `>= 43`. What this entry did NOT say, and 45 fixed: the
/// distinct scheme closes the version-SKEW hazard (a pre-43 redeemer silently over-granting) and
/// closes nothing for a CURRENT redeemer, which had no way to decline a ceremony it never offered
/// (#178); to 42 with the `peer_introduce` + `peer_endorse`
/// verbs — install a peer from a
/// SIGNED endorsement by someone you are already paired with, so a small group onboards in O(N)
/// instead of O(N²) two-human ceremonies (#65). It installs IDENTITY only and grants nothing, which
/// is what bounds it. Guard on `>= 42`; to 41 with `StreamFrame::BlobTransfer` — live app-blob
/// transfer progress on both the serving and fetching side (#82 ask 2), so an embedder can draw a
/// real progress bar instead of an indeterminate spinner. Guard on `>= 41` before expecting the
/// frame. NOTE what it did NOT bring, and 44 did: at 41 `blob_fetch` still blocked its whole
/// control connection for the transfer and nothing could cancel it (#172) — progress arrived on the
/// SUBSCRIBE connection, which is a different one; to 40 with `[services.<name>].rate_limit_per_min` +
/// `RegisterServiceParams::rate_limit_per_min` — proxied-request buckets became per
/// `(service, endpoint)` instead of one shared per-endpoint bucket, so a noisy service can no
/// longer starve a quiet one (#63). `-32053` changes meaning with it: it is now per-service, so a
/// consumer that backs off globally on one is backing off further than it needs to. Guard on
/// `>= 40` before sending the field or narrowing a back-off; to 39 with `PairParams::as_nickname` +
/// `InviteParams::peer_nickname` — LOCAL aliases for the other party, so a nickname collision is
/// resolvable by the person who hit it instead of requiring the other human to rename a machine or
/// re-mint. #147 made the collision diagnosable; this makes it fixable. Guard on `>= 39` before
/// offering an alias field in a UI: below it `deny_unknown_fields` rejects the whole request
/// (#87); to 38 with `[network].presence_mode` + `SelfNetwork.
/// presence_mode` — `reachable: false` gained a new meaning ("up, paired, and deliberately not
/// answering"), and `peer_services` flips from "reachable, empty list" to "unreachable" for a
/// caller holding no grant. A consumer must guard on `api_minor >= 38` before telling a user their
/// peer is offline, since below it that verdict could not mean this (#89); to 37 when the reserved
/// `mcpmesh/*` `_meta` namespace began
/// being enforced on EVERY proxied frame rather than the session's first. `run_session` treats
/// frame 1 as the `initialize` whatever its method is, so a caller could send any other method
/// first and put its real `initialize` — with a forged `mcpmesh/peer` naming another principal,
/// forged `groups` and all — in frame 2, where nothing stripped or injected. No shape changed;
/// what changed is whether `_meta["mcpmesh/peer"]` can be trusted, which is the entire reason a
/// backend reads it. Guard on `api_minor >= 37` before keying authorization on that value (#164).
///
/// **Not every semantic change gets a minor, and that is the gap to watch (#122).** A minor marks a
/// change to this *surface*. A change to behaviour BEHIND the surface — same fields, same shapes,
